Hey hey! 

It’s been a while. 

Though if I’m being honest, I don’t think anyone knew this site existed for the past year it’s been up. But that’s okay! It means no one had to see how barebones the old version was. I can sweep it under the rug without consequences. 

Onto the point, I feel like I’ve been fairly complacent this year. As my birthday approaches and the time has come once again to look back on the last few months, it’s a bit anxiety inducing. I’ve dedicated my time to courses and my work as a research assistant, but I haven’t been taking the effort to make projects or do stuff I consider fun. 

Back in high school, I used to enjoy writing and drawing a lot of art. Thinking up stories and sitting on my desk drawing pictures was how I got through the boredom of classes and the stress of the future. 

Now it just feels like everything’s been surrendered to the machine. I’ve gotta get through the degree machine and graduate. I’ve gotta utilize all the new AI tools and let it do the work for me. Thoughts like that have consumed me since I failed to get an NSF internship in January. This job market is scary... but I can only hope and keep preparing.

Surely it can’t hurt to be future-oriented, but maybe it wouldn’t hurt to pivot a little and try to appreciate the little things again. 

So! I cooked up a whole new design for this site! I even made it bilingual! 

I’ve got some plans in the works, and I’m excited to start dedicating my time to some personal projects again. Not just in coding, but writing, art, and all the rest that comes to my mind in the future.
